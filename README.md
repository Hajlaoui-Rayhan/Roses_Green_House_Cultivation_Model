# Roses_Green_House_Cultivation_Model
Design and implementation of an artificial intelligence model for environmental classification using Roses Greenhouse Cultivation Database Repository.
Then exporting it as a tflite model and a header file.
-	Loading the Roses-greenhouse-cultivation-database in TensorFlow
-	Data preprocessing
-	Implementing and evaluating our Deep Neural Network choosing the cross-entropy as the cost function and Adam Optimizer as the optimization algorithm.
-	Calculating the accuracy and plotting the confusion matrix
